As is the case with most famous dishes, there are more
ways than one to arrive at a good boeuf bourguignon. Carefully
done, and perfectly flavored, it is certainly one of the most
delicious beef dishes concocted by man, and can well be the main course
for a buffet dinner. - Julia Child, Mastering the Art of French Cooking
